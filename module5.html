            <h2>Module 5: 2 Mark Questions</h2>
            <div class="question-block">
                <h3>Question 1: What are the 'Trigunas' in Indian psychology? Name them.</h3><button class="toggle-answer-btn">Show Answer</button><div class="answer"><p>The 'Trigunas' are the three fundamental qualities or tendencies of nature (Prakriti) that constitute everything in the universe, including the human mind. They are:</p><ol><li><strong>Sattva:</strong> The quality of balance, harmony, purity, and wisdom.</li><li><strong>Rajas:</strong> The quality of activity, passion, ambition, and restlessness.</li><li><strong>Tamas:</strong> The quality of inertia, darkness, delusion, and inactivity.</li></ol></div>
            </div>
            <div class="question-block">
                <h3>Question 2: Define the 'Body-Mind-Intellect-Consciousness Complex'.</h3><button class="toggle-answer-btn">Show Answer</button><div class="answer"><p>This is a Vedantic model of a human being. It views a person as a composite of four distinct layers: the physical <strong>Body</strong>; the emotional and sensory <strong>Mind</strong> (Manas); the discriminating <strong>Intellect</strong> (Buddhi); and the pure, witnessing <strong>Consciousness</strong> (Atman) which is the true Self that illumines the other layers.</p></div>

                <h3>Question 6: What is the significance of water in the context of Indian wellbeing?</h3><button class="toggle-answer-btn">Show Answer</button><div class="answer"><p>Water holds a central role in Indian wellbeing, both physically and spiritually. Physically, Ayurveda emphasizes proper hydration for maintaining health and balancing bodily doshas. Spiritually and culturally, water (especially from sacred rivers) is considered a powerful purifying agent, used in daily rituals and temple ceremonies to cleanse the body and mind of impurities.</p></div>

                <h3>Question 7: How does the 'Yoga-way of life' go beyond physical postures?</h3><button class="toggle-answer-btn">Show Answer</button><div class="answer"><p>The Yoga way of life extends far beyond physical postures (asanas). As defined in Patanjali's Ashtanga Yoga, asanas are only the third of eight limbs. The system begins with ethical precepts (<strong>Yamas</strong> - restraints, and <strong>Niyamas</strong> - observances) and progresses through breath control (<strong>Pranayama</strong>) to deep states of meditation (<strong>Dhyana</strong>) and ultimately, liberation (<strong>Samadhi</strong>).</p></div>

                <h3>Question 8: Briefly compare the goals of governance in Ramayana and Arthasastra.</h3><button class="toggle-answer-btn">Show Answer</button><div class="answer"><p>The goal of governance in the <strong>Ramayana (Rama Rajya)</strong> is primarily ethical: to uphold Dharma at any cost and ensure the moral and material welfare of all citizens. The goal of governance in the <strong>Arthasastra</strong> is primarily pragmatic: to ensure the power, security, and material prosperity (Artha) of the state, even if it requires ethically ambiguous actions.</p></div>

                <h3>Question 9: Explain the Triguna system (Sattva, Rajas, Tamas) and its application in understanding human psychology.</h3><button class="toggle-answer-btn">Show Answer</button><div class="answer"><p>The Triguna system is a foundational concept in Indian philosophy, particularly the Sankhya school. It posits that Prakriti (material nature) is composed of three fundamental qualities or forces (Gunas):</p><ul><li><strong>Sattva:</strong> The principle of harmony, balance, purity, wisdom, and light. It leads to happiness and knowledge.</li><li><strong>Rajas:</strong> The principle of activity, passion, ambition, desire, and restlessness. It binds a person through attachment to action.</li><li><strong>Tamas:</strong> The principle of inertia, darkness, delusion, lethargy, and ignorance. It binds a person through carelessness and sleep.</li></ul><p><strong>Application in Psychology:</strong><br>In human psychology, these three Gunas are always present in the mind in varying proportions, determining an individual's personality, mood, and behavior. A person with a predominance of <strong>Sattva</strong> is calm, compassionate, and wise. A person dominated by <strong>Rajas</strong> is hyperactive, ambitious, and driven by desire. A person dominated by <strong>Tamas</strong> is lazy, prone to depression, and confused. The goal of spiritual practices like Yoga is to reduce Rajas and Tamas and increase Sattva, leading to mental clarity and peace.</p></div>

                <h3>Question 10: Describe the holistic approach to health and wellness in IKS, focusing on Ayurveda and Yoga.</h3><button class="toggle-answer-btn">Show Answer</button><div class="answer"><p>The Indian Knowledge System approaches health holistically, viewing a person as an integrated being of body, mind, and spirit. It focuses on maintaining balance and preventing disease rather than just treating symptoms.</p><ul><li><strong>Ayurveda:</strong> It defines health as a state of equilibrium between the body's three humors (<strong>Doshas</strong>: Vata, Pitta, Kapha), tissues (Dhatus), and waste products (Malas). It emphasizes that diet and lifestyle are primary medicines. The "three pillars" of health are:
    <ol><li><strong>Ahar (Food):</strong> Eating a balanced diet appropriate for one's unique constitution (Prakriti).</li><li><strong>Nidra (Sleep):</strong> Getting adequate and quality sleep for physical and mental repair.</li><li><strong>Brahmacharya (Right use of Energy):</strong> Moderation in all activities, especially sensory indulgence.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Yoga:</strong> Yoga provides the practical methodology for uniting the mind and body. It is not just exercise but a complete way of life that includes ethical principles (Yamas and Niyamas), physical postures (Asanas) to keep the body healthy, breathing techniques (Pranayama) to calm the nervous system, and meditation (Dhyana) to achieve mental clarity and reduce stress.</li></ul><p>Together, Ayurveda provides the framework for bodily balance, while Yoga provides the tools for mental and spiritual harmony, creating a complete and holistic system for wellness.</p></div>

                <h3>Question 11: Explain the Indian philosophical view of a person through the 'Body-Mind-Intellect-Consciousness Complex'.</h3><button class="toggle-answer-btn">Show Answer</button><div class="answer"><p>The Vedantic model describes a human being as a complex of four distinct but interconnected layers, with the subtler layers controlling the grosser ones. The goal is to understand and master these layers to realize one's true nature.</p><ol><li><strong>The Body (Annamaya Kosha):</strong> This is the outermost, physical sheath made of food. It is the grossest layer and the instrument for action in the world.</li><li><strong>The Mind (Manomaya Kosha):</strong> This is the emotional and sensory layer, subtler than the body. It is the seat of feelings, emotions, desires, and the five senses. It is characterized by its restless and fluctuating nature.</li><li><strong>The Intellect (Vijnanamaya Kosha):</strong> Subtler than the mind, this is the faculty of discrimination, reason, and decision-making. It has the power to analyze and judge the inputs from the mind. A disciplined intellect can control the wayward mind.</li><li><strong>Consciousness (Atman):</strong> This is the innermost and most fundamental reality, the pure, unchanging witness. It is not a part of the complex but the very 'light' or awareness that illumines the Body, Mind, and Intellect, allowing them to function. Realization of this Consciousness as one's true Self is the ultimate goal of life.</li></ol></div>

                <h3>Question 12: Discuss the principles of governance and public administration as derived from Kautilya's Arthasastra and the epic Ramayana. Compare and contrast these two models of the state.</h3><button class="toggle-answer-btn">Show Answer</button><div class="answer"><p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br>Ancient Indian political thought offers two powerful, yet starkly different, models of governance: the idealistic, dharma-centric 'Rama Rajya' from the Ramayana and the pragmatic, power-centric 'Kautilyan State' from the Arthasastra. Comparing them reveals a deep and ongoing debate in Indian tradition about the relationship between ethics and politics.</p><p><strong>Principles of 'Rama Rajya' (from Ramayana):</strong><br>This model represents an ideal state, a 'Dharma Rajya' where righteousness is the supreme principle.</p><ul><li><strong>Dharma-Centric Rule:</strong> The ruler (Rama) is an embodiment of Dharma. His every action is governed by moral duty, and he prioritizes upholding righteousness above his personal happiness or even family.</li><li><strong>Welfare of Subjects (Praja-ranjan):</strong> The primary goal of the king is the happiness and welfare of his subjects. The popular saying, "the happiness of the subjects is the happiness of the king," encapsulates this ideal.</li><li><strong>Rule of Law and Justice:</strong> Justice is impartial and accessible to all. The king himself is subject to the law and public opinion. Rama's decision to exile Sita based on a citizen's gossip, while tragic, is shown as an extreme act of placing public perception of dharma above personal feelings.</li><li><strong>Moral Foundation:</strong> The state is built on truth, compassion, and justice. There is no poverty, disease, or fear, and prosperity is a natural outcome of the righteous rule.</li></ul><p><strong>Principles of the Kautilyan State (from Arthasastra):</strong><br>This model, attributed to Kautilya (Chanakya), is a highly pragmatic and systematic manual for statecraft.</p><ul><li><strong>Artha-Centric Rule:</strong> The primary goal is the acquisition and preservation of Artha (wealth, power, material well-being) for the state. Dharma is important, but it is often subordinate to the security and prosperity of the kingdom.</li><li><strong>Centralized Bureaucracy:</strong> It prescribes a complex, highly organized administration with specific departments for finance, law, defense, etc., run by salaried officials.</li><li><strong>Pragmatism and Realpolitik:</strong> Kautilya advocates for practical policies. He details an extensive espionage system, the use of spies and secret agents, and justifies the use of force, deception ('upaya'), and political assassinations when the state's security is at stake.</li><li><strong>Economic Management:</strong> It has detailed sections on managing agriculture, trade, mining, and taxation to maximize state revenue and ensure economic stability.</li></ul><p><strong>Comparison and Contrast:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Goal:</strong> Rama Rajya's goal is Dharma and a morally perfect society. The Kautilyan State's goal is Artha and a secure, powerful, and prosperous state.</li><li><strong>Means vs. Ends:</strong> For Rama Rajya, the means must be as pure as the end. For the Kautilyan state, the ends (security of the state) can sometimes justify morally ambiguous means.</li><li><strong>Ruler's Role:</strong> Rama is a 'Rajarshi' (a sage-king), an ideal moral exemplar. The Kautilyan king is a 'Vijigishu' (one who desires to conquer), a shrewd and practical administrator.</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>Rama Rajya and the Kautilyan State represent the two poles of Indian political thought: the ideal and the practical. While Rama Rajya serves as the inspirational, ethical benchmark for what a perfect state should be, the Arthasastra provides the practical, and at times ruthless, playbook for how to run and protect a state in a complex and dangerous world.</p></div>
