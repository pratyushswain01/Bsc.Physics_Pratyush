## About The Project



Undergraduate physics students often juggle multiple textbooks, scattered notes, and hard-to-find online resources. This project aims to consolidate all essential learning materials for the BSc. Physics curriculum at **Saraswati Degree Vidya Mandir** into a single, elegant, and easy-to-navigate web portal.

This platform provides a centralized hub for subject-wise notes, syllabi, and curated learning resources, designed to be accessible anytime, anywhere, on any device.

### Key Features ‚ú®

* **Complete Syllabus Coverage**: Detailed, unit-wise breakdown for all core papers, including Waves & Optics, Mathematical Physics, Thermal Physics, and more.
* **Interactive Notes Viewer**: An advanced, gallery-style viewer for class notes with intuitive controls for zooming, panning, and fullscreen viewing.
* **Curated Resources**: Handpicked links to high-quality external resources like YouTube lectures, PhET simulations, and in-depth articles for every unit.
* **Modern & Responsive UI**: A clean, beautiful interface that works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
* **Personalized Experience**: Includes a sleek dark mode and an animated particle background for a pleasant user experience.

### Built With

This project is built with modern, lightweight web technologies, ensuring it is fast, accessible, and easy to maintain.

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** (with CSS Variables for Theming)
* **Vanilla JavaScript**
* **Font Awesome** (for icons)
* **Google Fonts** (for typography)

## Roadmap

This project is actively evolving. Here are some features planned for the future:

- [ ] üìö Add all remaining core and elective physics papers.
- [ ] üß™ Create a dedicated section for practical lab experiments and procedures.
- [ ] üßÆ Integrate a searchable database of important formulas and constants.
- [ ] üìù Develop a question bank with previous years' university questions.
- [ ] üîç Implement a global search functionality to find topics across all subjects.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/your-username/bsc-physics/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
