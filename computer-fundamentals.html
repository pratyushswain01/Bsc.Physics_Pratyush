                <h4>3. What is a binary code and why it is used in a computer?</h4>
                <p>Binary code is a system that represents text, computer processor instructions, or any other data using a two-symbol system, typically "0" and "1". It is used in computers because their fundamental components (transistors) operate in two states: on or off, which can be directly represented by 1 and 0, respectively. This makes it the most basic language of a computer.</p>

                <h4>4. What is a computer Algorithm and why is it important in computer science?</h4>
                <p>A computer algorithm is a finite, step-by-step set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. It is important because it provides a clear, unambiguous blueprint for writing a computer program. A well-designed algorithm ensures that the program is correct, efficient, and reliable.</p>

                <h4>5. What is a computer's cache memory and how does it improve performance?</h4>
                <p>Cache memory is a small, extremely fast type of volatile memory that provides high-speed data access to the CPU. It improves performance by storing frequently used data and instructions, reducing the time the CPU spends waiting for data from the slower main memory (RAM).</p>

                <h4>6. What is computer booting?</h4>
                <p>Booting is the process of starting a computer. It begins when the power is turned on and involves loading the operating system (OS) from the storage drive into the main memory (RAM). The initial instructions for booting are stored in the BIOS or UEFI firmware.</p>

                <h4>7. Define Register.</h4>
                <p>A register is a small amount of very fast memory located directly inside the Central Processing Unit (CPU). Registers are used to hold the data, instructions, and addresses that the CPU is currently working on, allowing for extremely quick processing.</p>

                <h4>8. What role does the ALU play in a computer system?</h4>
                <p>The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is a crucial component of the CPU. Its role is to perform all arithmetic operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication) and logical operations (like AND, OR, NOT). It is the mathematical brain of the computer.</p>

                <h4>9. Differentiate between static RAM and dynamic RAM.</h4>
                <div class="table-container">

                </ul>

                <h4>11. What is router and how is it different from repeater?</h4>
                <p>A <strong>router</strong> is a networking device that connects different networks and forwards data packets between them based on their IP address. A <strong>repeater</strong> is a simpler device that only regenerates and retransmits a network signal to extend its range, without any routing intelligence.</p>

                <h4>12. Write down the importance of networking.</h4>
                <p>The importance of networking includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Resource Sharing:</strong> Sharing hardware like printers and files.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Enabling email, video conferencing, and messaging.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access to Information:</strong> Providing access to remote databases and the internet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Centralized Management:</strong> Simplifying software updates and data backups.</li>

                    <li><strong>Hub:</strong> A basic Layer 1 device that connects multiple computers in a LAN. It broadcasts any incoming data packet to all connected ports, leading to inefficiency and traffic collision.</li>
                    <li><strong>Switch:</strong> A more intelligent Layer 2 device that connects devices in a LAN. It learns the MAC address of each connected device and forwards data packets only to the specific destination port, improving network performance significantly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Router:</strong> A Layer 3 device that connects two or more different networks (e.g., a home LAN to the Internet WAN). It uses IP addresses to determine the best path to forward data packets between networks. Routers are the backbone of the internet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repeater:</strong> A Layer 1 device used to regenerate and retransmit a weak network signal. It helps to extend the physical range of a network by combating signal degradation (attenuation) over long distances.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gateway:</strong> A versatile device that acts as a bridge between two dissimilar networks using different protocols. It performs protocol conversion to allow communication. A home router, for instance, acts as a gateway between the local network and the ISP's network.</li>
                </ol>
